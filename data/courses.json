        "description": " <p>This course explores the theological and spiritual foundations for being on mission'' in the city and for the city. The incarnation of Jesus is presented as the fundamental theological and dispositional concept for biblical urban mission, and serves as the lens through which social location and socio-cultural realities in urban communities are approached and understood. Emerging from this are an understanding of ''incamational witness'' and an ability to interpret contemporary urban issues in light of Scripture and missional theology. The urban ministry matters discussed serve as a primer for more detailed analyses in other praxis-focused courses.</p>",
