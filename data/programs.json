Specific program requirements are outlined below, and additional details can be found on the engineering website.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><strong>Application Requirements</strong> </p>\n<ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\n    <li>At least three full semesters, preferably four, must remain before graduation.</li>\n    <li>The applicant must first meet with the Chair of the Engineering Department. If approval to proceed is granted at the departmental level, the student must submit an application to the Office of the Director of the Honors Community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><strong>Admission Requirements</strong> </p>\n<ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\n    <li>Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.5, as well as a GPA of at least 3.5 in engineering courses.</li>\n    <li>Students must have completed at least ten credit hours of sophomore-level engineering courses. Transfer students must have completed at least two engineering courses at Union.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><strong>Progression Requirements</strong> </p>\n<ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\n    <li>Students must maintain a GPA of 3.5 overall and in engineering courses.</li>\n    <li>Students must complete each honors contract course with a grade of B or better and achieve satisfactory completion of the honors contract for each course.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><strong>Curriculum Requirements</strong> </p>\n<ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\n    <li>Students must take at least 12 credits of honors contract courses.\n    <ul>\n        <li>For electrical engineering concentration students, typical honors contract courses include EGR 361 (4 credits), EGR 405 (4 credits), EGR 475 (4 credits), and EGR 498 (1 credit).</li>\n        <li>For mechanical engineering concentration students, typical honors contract courses include EGR 320 (3 credits), EGR 352 (1 credit), EGR 355 (3 credits), EGR 475 (4 credits), and EGR 498 (1 credit).</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Students must complete an honors project that is distinctly different from the senior design project. The honors project will be either a research project or a humanitarian engineering design project, with specific requirements to be determined in conjunction with the student&rsquo;s departmental honors advisor. It is expected that a typical honors project will require roughly 250-300 hours of work.</li>\n    <li>Students in their junior and senior years must satisfy Honors colloquium requirements as determined and published by the directors of the Honors Community.</li>\n</ul>",

The honors thesis will build upon previous work undertaken in upper-level English courses, including work done for honors contracts. </p><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>Application Process</strong> </p><p class='sc-BodyText'>Students who meet the minimal requirements should submit an application to the Chair of the English Department.

Honors students will contract to perform honors work, to be defined by a collaboration between the student and the professor, in four upper-division courses in the major. The specific courses involved are delineated below according to their respective major tracks. The fourth of these courses will be an intensive research course focused on developing the honors thesis, which will be a synthesizing paper that builds upon the research focus developed in the prior honors courses. </p><p class='sc-BodyText'>After a student has satisfied requirements, the student may begin the discipline-specific honors program. In most cases, this will begin no later than fall of the junior year, but may begin once admissions requirements have been satisfied in order to accommodate students with multiple majors or an accelerated graduation timeline. The request to participate in the program should initiate with the student’s advisor, who will ensure that admissions requirements have been met. Students must have 3 full semesters remaining on campus in order to enroll in DSH, and honors-designated courses must be taken on-campus at Union so that the research can be directed by Union faculty. Study abroad sequences should be carefully planned in order to allow students to complete all course requirements and enroll in the program length of their choice abroad; students who plan a full semester abroad should begin the honors sequence no later than fall of the junior year, but enrolling in the spring of the sophomore year is recommended. Students may enroll in no more than two honors-contracted courses in the department per semester. All honors courses must be upper-level courses. If there is a compelling reason to do so that supports the student’s research goals, a student may request to take one of his/her honors courses outside the major department.</p><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>Specific designation of honors courses within the major will be as follows: </strong> </p><ol class=\"sc-ListNumber\">\r\n\t<li>The student in SPA or FRE honors will designate three 3-hour upper-level courses as honors courses, and the student and professor will work together to ensure that the honors component involves more in-depth and comprehensive research than the standard enrollment. The final honors-designated course will be SPA 417 or FRE 417, the Special Studies course, which will be an intensive research course completed with close guidance from the faculty member and focused on preparation and writing of the honors thesis.</li><li>The student in ALNG honors will designate ALNG 315, ALNG 325, ALNG 440, and ALNG 495 as honors-contracted courses. </li><li>The TESOL honors student will designate TESL 315, TESL 320, TESL 410, and TESL 440 as honors-contracted courses.</li><li>All honors students in the department will present their honors thesis in lieu of the standard capstone presentation when they enroll in the required SPA 490, FRE 490, TESL 490, ALNG 490 course during their final semester of coursework in the major. </li>\r\n</ol><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>Admission Requirements:</strong> </p><ol class=\"sc-ListNumber\">\r\n\t<li>3.5 minimum GPA in the major, including the completion of at least one upper-level course prior to entry into DSH</li><li>Recommendation to the program by the student’s academic advisor.</li><li>The student should have at least 3 semesters remaining at Union in order to meet the program requirement of designation of no more than two courses per semester as honors courses and allow time for preparation and presentation of the honors thesis. If students plan a fall or spring full-semester study abroad, they should plan to begin the DSH program no later than the fall of the junior year. They may incorporate research conducted abroad into their thesis research, but the honors-designated courses must be taken at Union to allow for oversight by a Union faculty member.</li>\r\n</ol><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>Progression:</strong> </p><ol class=\"sc-ListNumber\">\r\n\t<li>The student must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5 in the major in order to remain enrolled in discipline-specific honors.</li><li>The student must earn an A or B in each honors designated course and adhere to the timeline that the department specifies for his/her program.</li><li>If students fall short of any of these requirements, they will be placed on probation with the discipline-specific honors program and given one semester to rectify their shortcomings. If the required adjustments are not made within one semester, the student will be dismissed from the DSH program.

Students who are interested in this Honors program should refer to the general requirements for Discipline-Specific Honors (DSH) as well as the requirements for the program in physics below:</p>\n<ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\n    <li>To apply for admission to the Physics DSH program students must\n    <ul>\n        <li>have at least a sophomore standing,</li>\n        <li>have a cumulative 3.5 GPA on 15 or more credit hours,</li>\n        <li>be enrolled in or have completed PHY 311, and</li>\n        <li>have at least three, and preferably four, semesters remaining in their undergraduate career.</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Application should be made to the Chair of the Department of Physics and must be approved by the Department of Physics. Upon departmental approval, the application will be sent to the Honors Community leadership for final approval.</li>\n    <li>Physics DSH Students must complete all requirements for the major in physics. In addition, the student must complete DSH requirements established by the Honors Community.</li>\n    <li>Physics DSH students must complete 12 credit hours of honors-contract courses in physics: Physics Research (PHY 424 and PHY 425) plus three additional upper-division courses:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Three credit hours total must be obtained under an honors contract in the physics research courses (PHY 424 and/or PHY 425). The research must be done within an ongoing research project either at Union or at an off-campus research site. Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs) are ideal for this requirement. Students must present a paper and a talk which will be evaluated by departmental faculty and must meet high standards of excellence. The department maintains a rubric for evaluating these. The research must be presented at the Union University Scholarship Symposium or its successor. The student must make a good faith effort to present the research at a regional or national meeting.</li>\n        <li>The remaining nine credit hours of upper-division honors contract must be above PHY 311 and have a minimum prerequisite of PHY 232.</li>\n        <li>Honors contract work will consist of writing a review article on a relevant topic, preparing and giving one or more presentations on relevant topics, completing additional homework of a particularly advanced and challenging nature, designing a physical or computational experiment for a course that does not include a lab component, or a similarly demanding project approved by the department.</li>\n        <li>PHY 498 (Seminar) may be taken for 3 hours of honors contact. Only honors students may take this course for more than 1 credit hour.</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Physics DSH students must attend at least four regularly scheduled honors colloquia during each of the student&rsquo;s junior and senior years. Students who are only in Physics DSH for three semesters must attend two colloquia per semester for an overall total of at least six colloquia. Within one week of attending a colloquium, the student will submit a short written summary and reflection paper to the student&rsquo;s honors advisor. </li>\n    <li>A grade of C or below in any honors contract course will result in a student&rsquo;s re-evaluation by the department. In the absence of extenuating circumstances, the department will typically dismiss the student from the program. If a student receives more than one B for honors contract classes, the department will assess whether the student should be allowed to continue the program.</li>\n    <li>To graduate with Discipline-Specific Honors in Physics, the student must have both a 3.5 cumulative GPA and a 3.5 Physics GPA.</li>\n</ul>",

The contribution of the Christian community to the development of leaders in family relations is crucial. The Family Studies major focuses on the development of the individual in the context of family and society. The program is designed to prepare students for (a) professional careers in a variety of human service areas; (b) leadership roles in church, school, and community; (c) personal roles in family living; and (d) graduate education. Graduates who do not pursue graduate study typically find employment as parent educators, child life specialists and program directors in public and private agencies.</p>",

The honors project constitutes a scholarly action research project whereas students apply and then compare/contrast the chosen theories as they relate to practice.

Prospective students may declare their major to be athletic training upon entrance to Union University, but each student must still be formally admitted to the Professional Athletic Training Program before entering into the clinical phases of the sequential curriculum. Candidates must meet all criteria for acceptance in the program. A student may complete all criteria for admission but that does not guarantee acceptance into the program. Prospective candidates must submit the formal application to the Program Director of athletic training education by April 1 of each year to be considered for fall enrollment. All applicants will be ranked in accordance with their performance in the following categories: (1) overall GPA, (2) success in prerequisite coursework, (3) applicant essay, (4) recommendation/references, and (5) a formal interview with the Professional Athletic Training Program Selection Committee. During the interview, each member of the Professional Athletic Training Program Selection Committee will complete a scoring scale. Candidates will be evaluated on intellectual, social and technical skills relative to the athletic training profession. All components of the application process are individually weighted and scored. Individual scores are incorporated into a cumulative score that determines the candidate&#39;s rank. Enrollment in the Professional Athletic Training Program is limited to a program capacity of forty (40). Final admission into the program rests with the decision of the Professional Athletic Training Program Selection Committee. All student candidates will receive the admission decision in writing by May 1. Student candidates who were denied admission into the Professional Athletic Training Program will have the opportunity to reapply for admission for future enrollment. </p><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>Program Requirements</strong> </p><ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\r\n\t<li>All Professional Athletic Training Program students must complete a physical examination from a licensed medical practitioner and submit a complete health history and record of immunizations. </li><li>All Professional Athletic Training Program students must sign agreements in reference to the technical standards of the program, acknowledgment of the Union University Athletic Training Student Handbook, and the Hepatitis B Vaccination Election Form. </li><li>All Professional Athletic Training Program students will be required to maintain CPR certification (Professional Rescuer or equivalent) for the duration of the program and must be annually screened for tuberculosis. </li>\r\n</ul><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>Operational Fair Practices and Additional Fees</strong> </p><p class='sc-BodyText'>Some additional fees will apply upon entrance into Union University&#39;s Professional Athletic Training Program. </p><ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\r\n\t<li>Each student will be billed a laboratory fee of $50.00 per semester for clinical course work (AT 265, 275, 365, 375, 465, 475). </li><li>Each athletic training student will be billed an additional fee of $25.00 per year for liability insurance. </li><li>Students enrolled in AT 170 will be billed $30.</li><li>Each athletic training student will be required to invest in professional attire in order to meet the standards of professional practice in clinical education.</li>\r\n</ul>",

As part of their 12 hours of honors coursework, students are required to take CHR 498 Senior Seminar for 3 hours credit and to contract for honors in three upper-level CHR/GRK/HBR/PHL electives (9 hrs. credit total). Students will choose which courses to contract for honors in consultation with their thesis advisor, giving consideration to how they might shape their contract in order to contribute to their thesis research. Students will complete their honors thesis while enrolled in CHR 498.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-SubHeading\"><strong>Admission Requirements</strong></p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"> </p>\n<ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\n    <li>Students must have a 3.50 GPA in Theology and Missions.

Contract must be approved by student, course professor, and thesis advisor.</li>\n    <li>Students must complete each honors contract course with a grade of B or higher.</li>\n    <li>Students must complete the Library&rsquo;s Research Methods and Strategies training for Theology and Missions.</li>\n    <li>Students must attend one honors colloquium in each of the junior and senior years.</li>\n    <li>Students are expected to participate in the activities of the J. H. Eaton Society.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\">If, for whatever reason, a student fails to meet the program requirements, the thesis advisor will recommend to the dean and associate dean of the School of Theology and Missions that the student&rsquo;s program be placed on a semester-long probation. If after that probationary period, the student has met the program requirements, the student will be reinstated to full standing in the program. If the student fails to meet the program requirements, the dean or associate dean of the School of Theology and Missions will be responsible for either extending the student&rsquo;s probation for another semester or dismissing the student from the discipline-specific honors program. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-SubHeading\"><strong>Honors Thesis Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"> </p>\n<ul class=\"sc-ListBullet\">\n    <li>Selection and approval of a thesis advisor. Students will approach faculty members that would be appropriate supervisors for their general area of research interest.

Students must meet all deadlines and all other expectations that the course professor requires of non-honors students in CHR 498. Students should closely consult with their thesis advisor during the writing of their honors thesis. Upon completion of the thesis, the students will submit the thesis to their thesis advisor and, as a courtesy, to the course professor. The thesis review committee will be responsible for assigning a grade for CHR 498 in consultation with the course professor. Unless the CHR 498 course professor serves as a student&rsquo;s thesis advisor or on the thesis review committee, apart from reporting the student&rsquo;s performance on the ordinary expectations of the course, the honors program has no expectations of the CHR 498 course professor beyond what would normally be expected with respect to a non-honors student.</li>\n    <li>Successful defense of the project before an honor thesis review committee consisting of three faculty members. The honor thesis review committee will be composed of the faculty who taught the three contracted honors courses plus the thesis advisor. If this number does not total three faculty, the School of Theology and Missions administration will appoint additional faculty to the thesis review committee. The review committee is responsible to read the final draft of the thesis and interact with the student regarding their work during the defense.</li>\n</ul>",

General Honors courses fulfill Honors requirements and some General Core requirements. Admission to the General Honors program requires a successful application in a competitive process. All incoming freshmen who are admitted to Union and have a 3.5 GPA or a 28 on the ACT will be invited to apply to the General Honors program. Incoming freshmen who do not meet this criterion but think they are up to the challenge of Honors work are also welcome to apply. Transfer students and current Union students can be considered for admission to General Honors under certain circumstances.

Wisdom (6) F</strong> </p><p class='sc-BodyText'>Prerequisite: Admission to General Honors.</p><p class='sc-BodyText'>Wisdom has served, in many civilizations, as the highest goal of education. The Old Testament declares that wisdom “is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her” (Prov. 3:15). We will inquire after the nature of wisdom and seek the means of acquiring it, giving attention to biblical and extrabiblical literature as well as their historical contexts and their elaborations in subsequent traditions. We will consider contemporary applications of these traditions, including reflection upon the purpose and pursuit of contemporary higher education in light of wisdom. Exercises are aimed at developing various dimensions of wisdom within the self. Due to the nature and purpose of this course, as well as its student writing, it satisfies the first half of the Written Composition requirement in the General Core. </p><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>215. Beauty (6) S</strong> </p><p class='sc-BodyText'>Prerequisite: HON 205. Pre- or Co-requisites: HIS 101. </p><p class='sc-BodyText'>What exactly makes any particular person, poem, song or object beautiful? The nature of beauty will be explored through both theory and practice. Students will examine and produce beautiful things in various media, reflect on what makes them beautiful, and discuss the history of aesthetic theory—Eastern and Western, theological and secular—as a resource for answering these questions. The class will culminate in a gallery show involving both works of art and theoretically informed reflections upon them. The content, along with a focus on improvement of student writing, satisfies the General Core requirement for Arts in Western Civilization, as well as the second half of the Written Composition requirement.</p><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>225. Justice (6) S</strong> </p><p class='sc-BodyText'>Prerequisite: HON 205.</p><p class='sc-BodyText'>While most agree that a healthy society should be based on justice, there has been little agreement as to what justice is. In this course, we will search for an adequate definition— considering biblical and theological resources as well as philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, and Rawls— while looking closely at attempts to bring justice in particular communities and situations, both historical and contemporary. This course incorporates service-learning work and reflection upon it. This course satisfies the General Core Social Science/ Humanities requirement and, in light of the historical conflicts over justice, satisfies HIS 102.</p><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>235. Creation (4) F</strong> </p><p class='sc-BodyText'>Prerequisite: HON 205.</p><p class='sc-BodyText'>This course is an opportunity to develop tacit knowledge as it relates to scientific pursuits and to understand experientially the differences in the basic assumptions and methodologies held by various scientific communities. Along the way, students will encounter content from traditional physical and life science courses, but the central objective is to help students think in the same manner as a professional scientist without the benefit of many years of training. This course fulfills the General Core Laboratory Science requirement and can be applied <em>either</em>  to Group A <em>or</em>  Group B. </p><p class='sc-BodyText'><strong>419.
