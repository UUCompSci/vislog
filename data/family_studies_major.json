  "content": "<p class='sc-BodyText'>The family, as a basic building block of society, is critical to the functioning of society as a whole. The contribution of the Christian community to the development of leaders in family relations is crucial. The Family Studies major focuses on the development of the individual in the context of family and society. The program is designed to prepare students for (a) professional careers in a variety of human service areas; (b) leadership roles in church, school, and community; (c) personal roles in family living; and (d) graduate education. Graduates who do not pursue graduate study typically find employment as parent educators, child life specialists and program directors in public and private agencies.</p>",
